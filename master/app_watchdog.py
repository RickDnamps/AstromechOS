"""
App Watchdog — Application heartbeat App → Master.

The application (Android / web browser) sends POST /heartbeat every 200ms.
If no heartbeat is received for TIMEOUT seconds after a connection has been
established → full emergency stop (propulsion + dome).

Same principle as the UART Master→Slave watchdog, but for the application layer.

Protects against:
  - Android app crash
  - Browser tab closed during an action
  - WiFi loss of the control device
  - Phone screen turned off (WebView paused)

Start: app_watchdog.start() in master/main.py
Feed:  app_watchdog.feed() in status_bp.py POST /heartbeat
